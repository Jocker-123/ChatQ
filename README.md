Welcome to **ChatQ**, a Local Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. This project leverages FastAPI and integrates cutting-edge technologies like vector search, Elasticsearch, and optional web search. With ChatQ, you can harness the power of large language models (LLMs) such as Mistral or GPT-4 for intelligent question answering.

## Getting Started

To get started with ChatQ, you will need to clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Jocker-123/ChatQ.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd ChatQ
   ```

3. Install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Start the FastAPI server:

   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

Your ChatQ server should now be running at `http://localhost:8000`.

---

## Usage

Once the server is up, you can start making requests to the API. 

### Example Request

You can use tools like **Postman** or **cURL** to interact with the API. Here‚Äôs a simple example using cURL:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/ask" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"question": "What is Retrieval-Augmented Generation?"}'
```

### Example Response

The API will return a JSON response with the answer to your question:

```json
{
  "answer": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a framework that combines retrieval and generation techniques to answer questions more effectively."
}
```
